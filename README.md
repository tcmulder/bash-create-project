# Old Bash Project Creator
I built this simple bash script for my [Zenman](https://www.zenman.com/) team to create local and remote WordPress projects with some initialized elements, tied together via a crude bare repo system. It served its purpose till we were able to get a GitLab server set up and use webhooks instead.
